## Section 2: Working in Pairs

Use one person's fork of this repo to complete the following.

Partner B: use Partner A's repo


1. Partner A: add Partner B to your repo (under Settings)
2. Partner B: clone Partner A's repo to your machine
3.
   - Partner B: Add your name and hobbies to the README on your clone of Partner A's repo.
   - Partner A: Add your hobbies to the README on your local repo.

This will result in a merge conflict! (Unless you waited for each person to make their changes before making yours.) 

Let's go over how to fix this!!!
